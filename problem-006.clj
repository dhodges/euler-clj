;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 385

;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55 = 3025
;;
;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers 
;; and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
;;
;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers 
;; and the square of the sum.
